        <h1>Using with Preprocessors</h1>
        <p>
          A guide to using Tailwind with common CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus.

          Since Tailwind is a PostCSS plugin, there’s nothing stopping you from using it with Sass, Less, Stylus, or other preprocessors, just like you can with other PostCSS plugins like Autoprefixer.
          
          It’s important to note that you don’t need to use a preprocessor with Tailwind — you typically write very little CSS on a Tailwind project anyways so using a preprocessor just isn’t as beneficial as it would be in a project where you write a lot of custom CSS.
          
          This guide only exists as a reference for people who need to integrate Tailwind with a preprocessor for reasons outside of their control, not because it is a recommended practice.
